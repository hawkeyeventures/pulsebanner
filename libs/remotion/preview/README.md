# remotion-preview

The built in @remotion/player component https://www.remotion.dev/docs/player wasn't working super well and it's in expiremental phase.
Plus it has a ton of extra features to support playing remotion videos, which we don't need. 

So I just extracted the parts of it relevant to us into this much lighter bundle.
