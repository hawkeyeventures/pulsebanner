                    The vision for Streamlux, LLC and its affiliates (&quot;PulseBanner&quot;, “we”, “us”, and “our”) is to empower streamers on social media. As such, signing up
                    for PulseBanner is done through Twitter and Twitch. Your privacy is important to us. It is PulseBanner&lsquo;s policy to respect your privacy regarding any
                    information we may collect from you across our website, https://pulsebanner.com, and other sites we own and operate. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you
                    understand how we collect, use and share your personal information and to assist you in exercising the privacy rights available to you. We only ask for personal
                    information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why
                    we&lsquo;re collecting it and how it will be used. We do not share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required
                    to by law. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at

                <Text>
                    For purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act, we do not “sell” your personal information. In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to:
                    (i) request confirmation of whether we are processing your personal information; (ii) obtain access to or a copy of your personal information; (iii) receive an
                    electronic copy of personal information that you have provided to us, or ask us to send that information to another company (the “right of data portability”);
                    (iv) object to or restrict our uses of your personal information; (v) seek correction or amendment of inaccurate, untrue, incomplete, or improperly processed
                    personal information; (vi) withdraw your consent and (vii) request erasure of personal information held about you by us, subject to certain exceptions
                    prescribed by law. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set forth below. We will process such requests in accordance with
                    applicable laws. To protect your privacy, we will take steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request. If you are a California resident, you have
                    the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Streamlux for the exercise of your rights conferred by the California Consumer Privacy Act.

                    We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no system is 100% secure, and we
                    cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, we do not accept liability for
                    unauthorized disclosure. By using the Services or providing personal information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding
                    security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you
                    electronically by posting a notice on the Services, by sending an email to you.
