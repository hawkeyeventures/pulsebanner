                    Subject to these Terms, the Services are provided to you for free up to certain limits and with limited features. Usage over these limits or access to certain
                    features requires you to purchase a subscription. Your rights and obligations will be based on the type of payment plan you choose (i.e., free, personal, or
                    professional). Details about the different types of subscriptions, and the limits and available features associated with the Services, are available at
                    www.pulsebanner.com/pricing You may change the type of subscription at any time by (i) emailing us at pulsebanner@streamlux.com and following any instructions,
                    if any, we provide to you in response to your change request or (ii) initiating a change through your Account settings within the Services.

                    4.2 Authorization for Recurring Payments
                </Text>
                <Text>
                    If you purchase a subscription, you will be charged the then-applicable subscription fee (“subscription Fee”) at the beginning of your subscription and each
                    month, quarter or year thereafter, depending on the term of your subscription, at the then-current rate. subscription Fees are outlined at
                    www.pulsebanner.com/pricing. Please note that our subscription Fees are subject to change, although we will notify you before we effect any change in
                    subscription Fees. By agreeing to these Terms and purchasing a subscription, you acknowledge that your subscription has recurring payment features and you
                    accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your subscription by you or PulseBanner. We (or our third party payment
                    processor) will automatically charge you in accordance with the terms of your subscription (e.g., each month, quarter or year), on the calendar day
                    corresponding to the commencement of your subscription, using the Payment Information you have provided. In the event your subscription begins on a day not
                    contained in a given month, your payment method will be charged on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you
                    started a monthly subscription on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method would be billed on that date. We
                    may also periodically authorize your payment method in anticipation of applicable fees or related charges. Your subscription continues until cancelled by you or
                    we terminate your access to or use of the Services or the subscription in accordance with these Terms.

                <Text>
                    You may cancel your subscription at any time but please note that such cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current subscription period. YOU
                    WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. To cancel, you can
                    either (i) email us at pulsebanner@streamlux.com and follow any instructions, if any, we provide to you in response to your cancellation request, or (ii)
                    initiate a cancellation through your account settings within the Services. You will be responsible for all subscription fees (plus any applicable taxes and
                    other charges) incurred for the then-current subscription period. If you cancel, we will allow you to utilize features associated with such subscription until
                    the most recently paid-up subscription period ends. Cancelling your subscription won’t cancel your account.

                    supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between PulseBanner and you regarding the Services and Content. If for any
                    reason an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the
                    maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by
                    operation of law or otherwise, without PulseBanner’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be

                    those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by PulseBanner: (i) via e-mail; or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date
